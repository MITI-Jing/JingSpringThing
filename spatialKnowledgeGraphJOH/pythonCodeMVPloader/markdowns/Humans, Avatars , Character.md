- ## Character Consistency
	- I want to work it to get a character I like. Then I NEED: to be able to get that SAME character, totally consistant, from different viewpoints. High Fidelity.
	- Then its..... 1. Better voice to mouth stuff
	- 2. Environment and character can be treated seperate, but hte blending/compositing is super hard from an abstraction pov
	- 3. Animation

	- 1- Generate an image of character using the prompt "[SUBJECT], T-Pose 3D, full body" in @midjourney or other 2- Generate your 3D character using [https://tripo3d.ai](https://tripo3d.ai/) from @tripoai , export in custom preset "Cinema 4D" 3
		- Generate PBR texture using [https://lnkd.in/gBvGH_PH](https://lnkd.in/gBvGH_PH) from @AiDigimans 4- Animate it using [https://mixamo.com](https://mixamo.com/) from @Adobe 5- Integrate your model and texture into [https://spline.design](https://spline.design/) from @splinetool and make it cool !
