- ## The Gap
  id:: 659fe0be-a52a-42ef-8f50-73695a802945
	- McKinsey identified in 2022 that companies with a 5 year AI roadmap would likely pull ahead. [They called this "The Gap"](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/quantumblack/our-insights/the-state-of-ai-in-2022-and-a-half-decade-in-review#gap)
	- Hindsight shows us that this was correct. Those companies feel somewhat unassailable, but the nature of the research publishing environment, and pace of progress, means there are plenty of opportunities.

	- ### **DO play with tools**
		- Use the tools that come free with where you already keep your data.
		- Start to sort out your data. Learn it's structure, and whether it's useful to optimise it.
		- High quality data gives high quality outcomes.
		- Use the paid and private version of [RunDiffusion](https://app.rundiffusion.com/) to start to play with the open tooling. [[Fooocus]] is new and very accessible and on that platform with **everything** else of value.
		- See if there's something on the market that is trustable when your data and product are ready, don't spread data about too much.
		- Do check if this is worth it. Get an expert opinion. Bloomberg spent around $20M on a model based on their financial data only to find that GPT4 [still beats it](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.05862.pdf).
		- Think about integrating the open tooling into your product development, consider the software licenses. Take **some** legal advice.

		- Acknowledge that employees are already using AI at work, often without approval. Over half of people using AI at work are doing so without telling their bosses. [Microsoft put this number at a staggering 75%](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/worklab/work-trend-index/ai-at-work-is-here-now-comes-the-hard-part/) [[Microsoft Work Trends Impact 2024]]

			  |-----------|-------|

			  | Percentage of AI users who say it helps them save time | 90% |
			  | Percentage of AI users who say it helps them focus on their most important work | 85% |

		- Create a culture of exploration and openness around AI use. Encourage employees to share how they are using AI to assist their work.
		- Completely rethink and redesign work processes around AI capabilities, rather than just using AI to automate existing processes. Cut down the org chart and regrow it for AI.
		- Let teams develop their own methods for incorporating AI as an "intelligence" that adds to processes. Manage AI more like additional team members than external IT solutions.
		- Align incentives and provide clear guidelines so employees feel empowered to ethically experiment with AI.
		- Build for the rapidly evolving future of AI, not just today's models. Organizational change takes time, so consider future AI capabilities.
		- Act quickly
		- organizations that wait too long to experiment and adapt processes for AI efficiency gains will fall behind. Provide guidelines for short-term experimentation vs slow top-down solutions.
		- Realize there are only two ways to react to exponential AI change
		- too early or too late. The capabilities are increasing rapidly, so it's better to start adapting sooner than later.
	- ### Custom models
		- AI/ML is the high interest rate credit card of product development
		- The likely emerging trend for [[Large language models]] is small models optimised for your data, with API collaboration and support from a big foundational model.
		- Think [[Mistral]], replacing one of the experts with YOUR expert
		- This is kinda true for image and video too, in that you can blend workflows between powerful online systems and more nuanced personal models. (imagebashing).
		- ### How to train models?
			- Smaller data and workflows:
				- Do it yourself with suitable cloud hardware. This applies to all Gen AI.
				- [[LoRA]] are very accessible. Basically nudge the existing models for your requirements.
				- Low legal peril.
			- Medium scale problems:
				- Own the skills you need for your data / product problem.
				- There's a lot of guidance from the major players like Microsoft
				  [Develop Generative AI solutions with Azure OpenAI Service
			- Training | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/paths/develop-ai-solutions-azure-openai/)
				- Get in a private consultant like me and onboard the skills for your product / data problem
				- This is the same model a the hub and spokes needed for larger models
			- Large / complex product and data challenges:
				- The industry is set up around the necessary datacentres. These are centres of excellence, commercial labs, Universities, etc.
				- Engage commercial data team who get you up to speed and train your model on their hardware.
					- Salford Uni will doubtless have a strategy with Azure.

		- ### Roll out in the cloud.
		- Play with [Runpod](https://www.runpod.io/). There's some great [YouTube tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjiX3lCnwUI)
		- I use a [Lambda Labs H100](https://lambdalabs.com/).
		- Unless you really know what you're doing, or you have a LOT of data, I wouldn't buy GPUs and attempt the inferencing side yourself
