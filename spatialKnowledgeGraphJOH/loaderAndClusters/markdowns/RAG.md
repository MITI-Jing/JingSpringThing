- ### Essential Elements of RAG
	- RAG involves retrieval systems and generative models.
	- Retrieval systems source relevant external information.
	- Generative models create responses using this information.
- ### Embedding Models in RAG
	- Crucial for converting data into vector embeddings.
	- Facilitates the storage and retrieval of data in vector form.
	- Different types of embeddings for text, images, audio, etc.
- ### Vector Databases in RAG
	- Store vectorized representations of data.
	- Enable semantic searches beyond keyword matching.
	- Essential for handling large volumes of diverse data types.
- ### Language Models (LLMs) Integration
	- LLMs like GPT are used for generating responses.
	- They contextualize the retrieved information.
	- LLMs provide the capacity for nuanced and coherent output.
- ### Data Chunking and Pre-processing
	- Involves organizing data into manageable parts for processing.
	- Effective chunking improves data retrieval accuracy.
	- Overlapping data chunks can enhance context understanding.
- ### Multimodal Data Handling
	- RAG can process diverse data types (text, image, audio).
	- Presents computational challenges and potential for errors.
	- Requires careful alignment of different data types.
- ### Optimization and Debugging
	- Involves refining the interaction between components.
	- Debugging is critical to address hallucinations and inaccuracies.
	- Tools for evaluation and observability are essential.
- ### Applications and Use Cases
	- Suitable for complex tasks requiring external data retrieval.
	- Used in chatbots, customer service interfaces, and information systems.
	- Emerging applications in multimodal contexts (video/image search).
- ### Current Challenges and Limitations
	- Managing computational costs and complexity.
	- Addressing issues of compounded hallucinations in multimodal RAGs.
	- Balancing storage, computation, and output quality.
