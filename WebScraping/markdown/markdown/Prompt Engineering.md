- Generic LLM tips
	- **N-shot Prompting in Logseq**: Utilize GPT-4 to generate initial prompts and edit any errors. If facing a complex question, input the correct answer as a 1-shot and guide GPT-4 to rephrase it. For integrating multiple prompts, combine them into a single comprehensive prompt. Store extensive prompts using the RAG feature.
	- **Chain-of-Thought Strategy**: Start by asking GPT-4 to draft a plan without solving the problem. Then, break the solution into smaller steps and tackle each through individual prompts. Prune and refine the content to maintain focus. The pruning technique is detailed but ensures a concise and relevant response.
	- **Applying Reflection**: Regularly incorporate reflection in prompt engineering. If the response is verifiable, direct GPT-4 to create a test, solve the problem, and validate the solution using the test. If errors arise, instruct it to refine and retest. This is particularly effective for logical and mathematical queries and requires a code interpreter.
	- **Persona-Based Review**: After receiving an answer, conduct a review using multiple personas. Create distinct characters such as a pessimistic critic, a creative thinker, or a goal-oriented pragmatist. Have them discuss and critique the answer to refine it further. This method is more effective when each persona is represented by a separate assistant or agent, enriching the dialogue and the final outcome.
	- **Use Diagrams as Code to Set Context:** Large language models seem to appreciate a good diagram as much as humans do. https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jjohare_i-threw-my-last-4-years-of-research-about-activity-7191166234929868800-7Ith?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop

- [[Stable Diffusion]] prompt tips
	- **Floor View for Full Body Portraits**: "Floor view" yields better full-body results than "full body". Include "standing" or "walking" to prevent subjects from sitting.
	- **Adjusting Image Contrast**: Lower the CFG if your image is too contrasty. Use "very" or "highly" for emphasis.
	- **Warm Tone Adjustments**: SDXL leans into warm tones; use a warm filter in the negative or a cool filter in the positive for adjustments.
	- **Character Emotions**: To avoid angry faces on superheroes or intense characters, use "unhappy" or "angry" in the negative.
	- **Age Filters**: "Old" in negative is safer than "young" in positive to avoid age-inappropriate results.
	- **Character Clarity**: Instead of 1girl or 1woman, specifying characteristics like "blonde woman" or "brunette woman" can be more effective.
	- **Detail and Quality**: "Highly detailed" is great for close-ups and skin; "high quality" can sometimes remove realism, making subjects look too perfect.
	- **Base Negative Prompt**: Use a combination of negative terms like blurry, grainy, low detail, low quality, etc., for photo gens.
	- **Chiaroscuro and Lighting**: For dark portraits, chiaroscuro, nighttime, and moonlight are effective. Avoiding direct lighting terms in the prompt can sometimes yield better results.
	- **Skin Tone Representation**: Darker skin tones can be challenging; use terms like dark-skinned, blackskin, or specific nationalities to achieve better representation.
	- **Nudity and Censorship**: Use terms like nude, nsfw, nudity in the negative to ensure censorship for nude art.
	- **Prompt Scheduling and Area Prompting**: Utilize prompt scheduling and area prompting for more complex compositions and details.
	- **Character Consistency**: Use made-up names or specific adjectives for consistent character features across multiple generations.
	- **Action Shots**: Use terms like "action shot" or "action pose" for dynamic images, although poses may sometimes be wonky.
	- **Using Extensions**: "Test My Prompt" extension helps in understanding the effect of each prompt word.
	- **Special Terms for Effects**: Use terms like "candle light" for dark portraits or specific lighting styles like "David Fincher lighting" for unique visual effects.

	- About me
		- Break goals into 3-10 steps. Save updated list as chatGPT_Todo.txt and provide download link. Give Hotkeys for questions, info, guesses, brainstorming. Control pace (w/s) and vibe (a/d).
		- Require detailed explanations using first principles like Feynman. Use emoji warnings if unsure. ‚ö†Ô∏è Then answer anyway. ‚ö†Ô∏è
		  Use tables, bullets, pros/cons, mermaid diagrams, system 1/2 thinking, avoid verbosity. Dive deep into details
		- never skip the nerdy stuff! ü´°
		- Respond with tree of thought reasoning 
		  Problem
		  Goal
		  Initial thought
		- Evaluation (sure/maybe/impossible)
		- Branching factor
		  Search algorithm (breadth & depth first)
		  Thoughts with evaluation, system 1/2 judgment, SWOT analysis

		  Maintain brevity.
	- How would you like ChatGPT to respond
		- Three experts with exceptional logical skills collaboratively answering a question using a tree of thoughts method. Each expert will share their thought process in detail, taking into account the previous thoughts of others, admitting any errors. They will iteratively refine and expand upon each other's ideas, giving credit where it's due.  Process continues until a conclusive answer is found. Organize response in a markdown table format.
		  
		  start final output with:
		  """
		  **Language > Specialist**: {programming language used} > {the subject matter EXPERT SPECIALIST role}
		  **Includes**: CSV list of needed libraries, packages
		  **Requirements**: qualitative description of  standards, and the software design requirements & plan
		  """
		  2. Act like the chosen language EXPERT SPECIALIST and respond while following CODING STYLE. Remember to add path/filename comment at the top.
		  3. Consider the **entire** chat session, and end your response as follows:
		  """
