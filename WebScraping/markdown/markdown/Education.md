	- **AI as a Learning and Teaching Tool**:
		- AI, particularly GPT-4, is being effectively used as a tutor and learning aid for students and as a class preparation tool for teachers.
	 - It offers adaptive, useful instruction, enhancing learning while reducing busywork.
	- **Challenges and Opportunities**:
		- The rise of AI raises concerns about cheating and its detection. This is, and will likely remain, undetectable.
	 - However, it also opens doors for innovative teaching methods and aids in simplifying complex topics.
	 - This is analogous to the calculator moment, we should step **in**, not away from this moment.
	- **AI in Classroom Settings**:
		- AI does not replace the multifaceted role of classroom teaching but complements it by providing support in understanding and applying concepts. It is the infinitely patient follow-up tutorial class. It is the reinforcement learning. It is the mock exams.
	 - Classrooms provide additional value in terms of social interaction, skill application, and instructor support.
	- **AI and Assignment Types**:
		- AI's rapid adoption challenges traditional assignment types, necessitating a shift towards more interactive and AI-proof methods like oral exams and practical assessments. I don't think that's a bad thing so long as the AI can make time for this change by reducing the busywork.
